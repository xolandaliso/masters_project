Some of the work I did for my Master's research project.

 ### MCMC notebook:
 it's a python code that fits a model to data using the recently developed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) agorithm i.e. emcee ensemble sampler algorithm.
 
### Automated_Geometry:
this is code automates the process of extracting position velocity slices from a fits data cube. It is based on the software package called kpvslice (found in software program kvis) which is basically a manual way of doing this.

### data_cube_par:
this code basically parameterizes each HI line profile of a data cube with a 3rd order Gauss-Hermite polynomial. In non-scientific terms it fits 3rd order Gauss-Hermite polynomial to the single emission profiles from the data cube. This is usually done in HI Astronomy to account for the noisy pixels found in the data.
